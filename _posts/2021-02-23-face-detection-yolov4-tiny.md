title: Face detection with YOLOv4 tiny and deploy on Jetson Nano.
---

This is a part of my project which aims to deploy a light-weight face detection on Jetson Nano. This method achieved about 25-30fps.

Guide to setup is shown in github project:

```

I used fork repo of darknet (up-to-date one) at: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

Please read the construction of darknet carefully to correctly install it on your specific system.
